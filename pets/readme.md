All pets are retrieved from the original project:  https://github.com/Adrianotiger/desktopPet/tree/master/Pets  
You can create and upload your pet on this repository. The new pet will be available to the desktop application, javascripts on browsers and on the mobile phone app.

<h3>Rules:</h3>
* Everyone can upload their own pet.
* Only working pets can be uploaded (check them with the application).

<h3>For developers:</h3>
To create your own animation, use the online generator at: http://esheep.petrucci.ch/pets/generator.php
Once you created your pet, you can check it executing the windows application pressing SHIFT when you launch it.
Once you have the xml, upload it on this folder and update the <em>pets.json</em> file
