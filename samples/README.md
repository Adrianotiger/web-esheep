## Demos

\* You can see all working demos directly on the GitHub webpage:

### Demo 1
[https://adrianotiger.github.io/web-esheep/samples/demo1.html](https://adrianotiger.github.io/web-esheep/samples/demo1.html)

Load and play the sheep on a webpage with 4 TAG-elements.

### Demo 2
[https://adrianotiger.github.io/web-esheep/samples/demo2.html](https://adrianotiger.github.io/web-esheep/samples/demo2.html)

Same as Demo 1, but with the default animation. This works only if the browser allows cross script requests (press F12 on your browser to see any exception during the execution of the script).
